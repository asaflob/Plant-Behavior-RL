## 1. Project Goal

Plants constantly manage the trade-off between $CO_2$ uptake and water loss via their stomata. Due to numerous environmental inputs, it is difficult to predict or explain why a plant adjusts its stomatal openings in real-time.

Our project's goal is to model this process as a Reinforcement Learning agent. This will allow us to move beyond simple prediction and use Explainable AI (XAI) to interpret the plant's decision-making strategy. This is vital for researchers and farmers seeking to optimize crop efficiency and water usage.

## 2. Project Setup & Technologies

This project is developed in Python. The environment requires the following libraries and tools:

### Core Libraries
* **Data Handling:** Pandas and NumPy 
* **RL Algorithms:** PyTorch and Stable Baselines3
* **Explainability (XAI):** SHAP and Captum
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn

### Tools & Hardware
* **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook 
* **Version Control:** Git 
* **Hardware:** GPU-enabled systems for efficient training
